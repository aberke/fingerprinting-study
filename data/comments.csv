You haven't gathered my browsing information yet?
Good luck 
Thank you.
"I'm willing to give my data over because you're using it for research and asked nicely, but sadly most companies online want it for profit and that bugs me."

It was interesting to do.
The study was very interesting and made me think more deeply about how my information within web browsers could be used.
Thank you for letting me participate in your study. 
"It is of great concern the constant tracking and probing online, creepy and anxiety-producing, yet i need internet daily at my job, and im noe exposing mysrlf much more, doing all these studies, yet need the money, exhausting."
Happy Holidays!!!
I know that spying happens when I'm merely t doing a simple search and countless ads related to that search appear.
None.
the study was good
Thank you
"My understanding is that it's really just used for ads, but not sure how it works beyond looking at cookies :)"

It would be interesting to know the results of your survey.

Nice
I don't know anything about what makes a computer work. I only know how to find certain files and troubleshoot. 
I only said yes to tracking because it is MIT!
No comments
I know they do it; I'm just not that concerned because I can't really do anything about it. 
Thank you
No thank you 🤣
I got lost.
Everything seemed to work fine for me.  I tried to give the best answers I could to help out.  Thank you for allowing me to participate.  Have a nice day.
decent survey
I enjoyed taking part in this study! :)
"While I acknowledge the risks of data tracking in most respects, the realities of its consequences are so abstract that the effort required to prevent it seem overwhelmingly prohibitive. Its apparent pervasiveness also makes that effort seem futile, or at the very least expensive. Privacy is not regarded as a right in all cases."

Hello. Thank you for letting me contribute. Now I'm curious what data can be collected from me by simply just browsing the internet. Good luck in your work.
none
It was informative to the point I truly pay attention to how I engage online.
"I presume a lot of websites track me to tailor ads. I block ads pretty aggressively though, so I'm not terribly worried about that particular motivation.  "
Companies collect personal data to sell and analyze. We know lol. It's a multi billion dollar industry.

Thanks for the study.
Interesting survey.

Thank you
Shouldn't you provide an explanation of browser fingerprinting BEFORE you ask users to consent to sharing their browser information? The fact that you ask about browser fingerprinting afterward is kind of suspect. Participants that aren't aware of browser fingerprinting won't know what they're opting into.
No idea what browser fingerprinting is! Sorry

"Thank you for the opportunity to participate. If you do future studies you should encourage usage of people's most commonly use browsers. I use Chrome for Prolific and other sites (thus didn't want to provide my browser metrics), but I normal use Brave, a Privacy Browser and I would have allowed the metrics and fingerprinting against it."
I think you should write out exactly what data and information you are collecting; make it clearer.

There is NO privacy on the internet period . The only thing you can do is stay off of it and only use it for things that are necessary  and have the best private security monitoring you can find which I do . 
Interesting Study!

"I have sadly reached the point where I just feel that all this tracking insanity has reached a point of no return. Artificial intelligence? Has done NOTHING to make my life easier in fact we are being used to build/train it and its done only 2 things... 1? its allowed people to cheat and create reports and such as if they did research its a lazy persons tool to cheat more or less. 2) its stolen our privacy and sites like reddit, facebook are selling decades of my data to build this into the ultimate privacy invader. AI is junk.. Data is the new oil.. "

I prefer these types of 1-2 min studies.

The primary reason I'm okay with this study fingerprinting my device is because it's for the purchase of an academic survey and for payment.

What shall you do with this data?
"While I don't know the deep technical details, I am aware that there are many companies out there that collect browser information and associated data for various purposes.  Unfortunately there's not enough visibility into this from a consumer standpoint.  While there has been an improvement in cookie notifications since GDPR was established, there needs to be more transparency from companies like Google, Verizon, Facebook, and other large infrastructure providers.  "

Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was resurrected and he died for your sins and rose from the grave and b saved.  Amen"

"That was fascinating! It was a good reminder that browser fingerprinting happens often! I just...don't realize it. I guess it's up to me to be more careful in which cookies I opt into but if it's not cookies...then...what gets me less fingerprinted? I'd love to know the results of this study for sure and some best practices about browser fingerprinting! I mean it didn't record IP addresses, but for it to know my fonts and resolution was something else for sure that I didn't expect. I didn't mind giving it my browser name but those minute details were...a lot more invasive than I thought. This was cool to take! Thank you for making me reflect in this way!"

"Generally, I am only concerned about my data and privacy when I do something related to payments or finances. I don't use my computer for a lot of important things so I am not usually super concerned with data tracking."
"I know that companies are stealing my data and selling it, it would be nice to see a cut of the profits."
Good study! Interesting topic and questions. Enjoyed participating!
Good luck

I was just reading today about Googles Privacy Sandbox project it is supposed to replace cookies with a different kind of tracking that Google says is better for our privacy. 
"none, thanks"
I’m taking this on Chrome for iOS but the fingerprint indicated Mozilla
"browser fingerprinting not to much information on this topic, but i like to know more"
Happy Holidays!
Very clear
Data privacy is very important to me.
Nope. 
Thank you!
"I understand that websites collect a lot of info.   I get that.   I'm American, so I don't expect any online privacy.   It just comes with the territory, but, that being said, I'm not going to volunteer to share anything."
None 
Good luck.
All good here. 
I love that you are speaking on this because this is something that a lot of people have no clue about nobody knows what fingerprinting is in your browser where people can know your information and continue the browser.
Thanks

I'm more concerned with these things gumming up my computer than I am with privacy.  I expect NO privacy any more no matter what I choose.
interesting 
What exactly is fingerprint tracking and how do companies do it?

sorry about declining to share my website fingerprints.  I just don't know enough about it to share that data.

It's the price we pay for Internet. Just be mindful.

"You had 2 things wrong. I never use Google, and my resolution is 1920x1080, not 864x1536.  As for privacy, I use Ghostery in my browser, which prevents tracking."
All clear. Have a good holiday.
"I chose Neutral due to I believe websites do look at our website footprint, however, to use the web and other applications, they need to and I believe that it ok.  I believe it is up to that web page or website to protect my information."
No
"Privacy is almost impossible in this era, unfortunately."

Would've been nice to be able to see what data was collected.
Secific info about the possible IDing of my device as a by-product of this research data would have been helpful (i.e. how and how to prevent)
I am always concerned about fraudulent activity that may arise when companies use tracking devices. You never know who will eventually obtain that data.
I’d be interested in finding.out what web fingerprinting is
i would have given you my data if you had mentioned a bonus for doing so. i'm easy like that
Good to know.
No issues at all. Thanks!
Thank you
Thank you for the study!
"I think it's impossible to have privacy these days. But when I read your request I wasn't positive what I would be agreeing to, so I declined."
thank you for the opportunity to participate
"Quick and easy study, I've not heard of browser fingerprinting. I will assume this is the same a tracking."
Best wishes as you proceed with your research project. 
Very little can be done about internet browsing if it is on your own computer or phone. 
Good luck

Happy Holidays!

That's really scary to think about someone out there has access to everything that's stored in your computer. Thanks for the opportunity.
I try to browse with security in mind.
thanks a lot
