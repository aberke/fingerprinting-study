Thank you for the opportunity. 
What shall you do with this data?
Keep up the good work.
I think companies track too much information to the point it can be intrusive and an invasion of privacy. It scares me because I wonder if they could track payment information entered online.
Thank you the opportunity to participate!
I know that spying happens when I'm merely t doing a simple search and countless ads related to that search appear.
None.
"While I don't know the deep technical details, I am aware that there are many companies out there that collect browser information and associated data for various purposes.  Unfortunately there's not enough visibility into this from a consumer standpoint.  While there has been an improvement in cookie notifications since GDPR was established, there needs to be more transparency from companies like Google, Verizon, Facebook, and other large infrastructure providers.

"While I acknowledge the risks of data tracking in most respects, the realities of its consequences are so abstract that the effort required to prevent it seem overwhelmingly prohibitive. Its apparent pervasiveness also makes that effort seem futile, or at the very least expensive. Privacy is not regarded as a right in all cases."

The study was great.
"I have read an article or two that talks about when you use incognito mode that some of the websites can still figure out who you are anyway, and that kind of bothers me"
Are you really tracking my browsing habits? Thank you!
"I think I would have been more likely to share my data from my browser if it was presented to me and I was able to see the data before it was submitted. Without knowing exactly what is collected, I was not comfortable consenting to do so. I also understand that websites could collect without my consent, but I would always like to look things over first, or have the choice, if ever possible."

Corporate surveillance is worse than law enforcement surveillance in every case. Law enforcement entities are required to prove probable cause and get a warrant from a judge. No one is requiring corporations to go through any regulatory process! It's disgusting!!

It would be nice to know if you actually collected our data for this survey or not
"Unsure. I‚Äôm kind of worried because I may be logged into sensitive data websites such as medical and financial sites currently, nonetheless I trust the researchers."
Nothing to add
I was just reading today about Googles Privacy Sandbox project it is supposed to replace cookies with a different kind of tracking that Google says is better for our privacy. 
"Had this wishing to share attributes in description, I would not have accepted this survey which likely was reason not to dive that info."
Not allowed to do unreasonable searches because of that pesky constitution? NO problem! Get your richie-rich buddies that own social media propaganda companies to do it for you!

dont know what finger tracking is
Privacy is important 
Thank you!
Shouldn't you provide an explanation of browser fingerprinting BEFORE you ask users to consent to sharing their browser information? The fact that you ask about browser fingerprinting afterward is kind of suspect. Participants that aren't aware of browser fingerprinting won't know what they're opting into.
Have a nice day!
"Great study, thank you. "

I hope there is a debriefing page after this that is educational about what the fingerprinting is because I've never heard of it 
"Everyone takes a risk when surfing the internet. Whether you have protection, or great protection."
I didn't know this was even a possibility until now...
"I understand that websites collect a lot of info.   I get that.   I'm American, so I don't expect any online privacy.   It just comes with the territory, but, that being said, I'm not going to volunteer to share anything."
May the forces of darkness become confused on the way to your home.

"That was fascinating! It was a good reminder that browser fingerprinting happens often! I just...don't realize it. I guess it's up to me to be more careful in which cookies I opt into but if it's not cookies...then...what gets me less fingerprinted? I'd love to know the results of this study for sure and some best practices about browser fingerprinting! I mean it didn't record IP addresses, but for it to know my fonts and resolution was something else for sure that I didn't expect. I didn't mind giving it my browser name but those minute details were...a lot more invasive than I thought. This was cool to take! Thank you for making me reflect in this way!"

"I have sadly reached the point where I just feel that all this tracking insanity has reached a point of no return. Artificial intelligence? Has done NOTHING to make my life easier in fact we are being used to build/train it and its done only 2 things... 1? its allowed people to cheat and create reports and such as if they did research its a lazy persons tool to cheat more or less. 2) its stolen our privacy and sites like reddit, facebook are selling decades of my data to build this into the ultimate privacy invader. AI is junk.. Data is the new oil.. "

The primary reason I'm okay with this study fingerprinting my device is because it's for the purchase of an academic survey and for payment. If large data collection companies like google were willing to provide me with some compensation or assure me that my data was being used in some meaningful way towards academia I think I would be slightly more inclined with giving my information to them. 
I didn't have any problems. 
Thank you!
I do not consent to the sharing of my data

"I'm not really worried. There are no nefarious reasons to track me. This is mainly for marketing reasons. People think the government/a cabal is tracking their online activities when the reality is no one cares, besides for marketing tactics. "
Thank you
"doing surveys has always concerned me, but the enjoyment and benefits of doing surveys far outweighs my fears.  "

Secific info about the possible IDing of my device as a by-product of this research data would have been helpful (i.e. how and how to prevent)
"The horse has bolted, profit motivates all infringement of privacy."
I really enjoyed the studies. Thank you.

Thanks
I hit neutral because I‚Äôm concerned but concerned enough to care 
Personally I feel internet privacy is important. I also feel I don't do enough to protect my privacy out of ignorance on how to do so properly.
Nothing comes to mind. 
It hasn't hurt me yet.  
Thank you 
Thanks for the study.

You should pay more. 
Very interesting unique study
"I use Duckduckgo and try to block cookies where I can, but I am still concerned about tracking and privact in general."
thank you for this opportunity!
Everything worked great.  Thank you and good luck!
Good study! Interesting topic and questions. Enjoyed participating!
it is a huge business to track people and oftentimes you can't get on a website without allowing cookies/tracking

I would be very open to participating in any future study which would shed more light on the practices of fingerprinting and brower behavior/data collection.
