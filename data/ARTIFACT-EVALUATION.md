## Description

This is a first-of-its-kind open dataset that can enable future web browser fingerprinting research. It contains browser attributes collected from N=8400 users' devices, along with the users' sociodemographic information which they provided via a survey. All data were collected and published with users' informed consent.
This dataset was described as a contribution in our paper "How Unique is Whose Web Browser? The role of demographics in browser fingerprinting among US users".


### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns
Data collection and publication can pose risks to the users from whom data were collected. These risks were described to the users who participated in our study, and the study allowed users to opt in to share their data or decline to share their data. Users were paid to participate in our study where or not they chose to share their data.

Our data collection process, data publication, and research were approved by the MIT Institutional Review Board (E-5494).

See the "Ethics and informed consent" subsection of our paper for further information on how we handled potential risks to study participants.


## Accessibility and Basic Requirements

No special hardware or software is needed to access the data. 
The data can be downloaded via Harvard Dataverse at the following link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0SGZFF

Harvard Dataverse supports permanent dataset preservation (https://support.dataverse.harvard.edu/harvard-dataverse-preservation-policy) and this dataset link is expected to remain stable.

The dataset can be downloaded only after researchers agree to the terms of use.

Anyone who wishes to reproduce the findings in our paper can do so by loading the data into our analysis notebooks. 
See `/data-analysis`. 
The analysis notebooks can be run via Google Colab or via Jupyter.
The runtime for each analysis notebook varies and can take up to 3 hours.


## Notes on Reusability

Web browser attributes can change as users update their configurations or update their browser installations. Our data were collected in December of 2023. Researchers using the dataset should keep in mind that it may represent older browser versions or trends in user preferences.
